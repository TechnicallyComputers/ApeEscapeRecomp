# ApeEscapeRecomp — Issues

Current state (v0.0.2-alpha): Ape Escape **boots from the PS1 BIOS and plays** as
a native Windows program — through the intro, title, and gameplay, with dual-
analog controller input. It has not yet been verified all the way to the end, so
treat it as a very playable preview rather than a certified full playthrough.
**Memory-card save/load now works** (issue #4 fixed in v0.0.2) — progress saves
and loads back on standard `.mcd` images.

An **experimental 16:9 / 21:9 widescreen** mode is available in the launcher
(off by default). It uses Ape's stable GTE projection-and-stretch path for a
wider 3D field of view. Regular **4:3 is the accurate default** and is
unaffected.

## #1 — Widescreen: title sky "dome" doesn't reach the wide corners — FIXED

In widescreen, the **title and some menu screens** draw their sky as a
GTE-projected 3D dome mesh authored to fill a 4:3 frame. Its curved edge doesn't
reach the corners of the wider frame, so those corners show black. The 3D world,
gameplay skies, and cutscene skies all fill correctly — this is specific to the
finite sky-dome billboards on a few screens.

**Fixed** by identifying the title overlay's exact 16x16 sky-mesh projection
call (`0x8013660C`, return `0x80136614`). Only that producer bypasses the normal
widescreen X squash, preserving its authored 4:3 coverage for the final frame
stretch. The old depth-gated experiment is not used, so attract-demo geometry
is untouched.

## #2 — Widescreen: ferris-wheel cars cull at the 4:3 edge — FIXED

The ferris cabins remain submitted throughout the amusement-park shot on Ape's
original projection-and-stretch widescreen path. The unrelated native-wide
compositor and broad automatic/per-object cull experiments were removed from
the game config; those experiments caused severe attract-demo geometry wedges
without owning the cabin behavior.

---

## #3 — Widescreen: distance (draw-distance) pop-in at very wide FOV — OPEN

Separate from the edge culling above: the game stops drawing objects beyond a
fixed **distance** from the camera (a classic PS1 draw-distance / far-clip cull).
A wider field of view — especially at 21:9 — lets you see farther toward that
limit, so distant objects can be seen spawning in and out by *range* rather than
at the screen edge. This is a Z/distance cull, not an aspect-ratio one, so the
edge-cull widening doesn't touch it.

**Desired:** make the draw distance configurable (push it out so the player never
sees distant objects pop in/out, in whatever aspect they're playing). That means
tracing the game's distance-cull constant(s) and widening them behind a per-game
config knob (an opt-in, since a larger draw distance costs some performance and
changes the authored look). Same investigation shape as #1/#2 — deferred with
them.

## #4 — Memory-card save/load does not complete — FIXED (v0.0.2)

Reaching the memory-card screen to save or load progress did not complete. The
low-level card protocol worked on both this runtime and the Beetle oracle (card
reads succeed, an empty card reports empty, the SwCARD I/O-complete flag sets and
the card fhandler runs), so this was a **higher-layer timing race**, not a dead
card path. Two nondeterministic failure modes were seen: a soft stall on
"Checking… MEMORY CARD" (the interrupt-driven async card read aborted partway),
and, less often, a hard freeze from a register smear at the card-op consumer.

**Fixed** by a framework-level change to how a cooperative in-exception
thread-switch is *deferred* across interrupt delivery. The deferred switch is now
kept pending at dirty-interpreter pump sites (where a candidate resume PC is
committed but the live CPU state may not yet be materialized) and is not deferred
at all when the interrupted PC is in low BIOS/kernel space (which would otherwise
re-enter the same VBlank handler forever and starve the target thread). The switch
is honored only at a boundary where the resumed thread's CPU state is coherent, so
the card read/write completes cleanly. Class-level fix in the framework (no
per-game poke); validated on Ape Escape and regression-checked against MegaManX6
and Tomba (1).

## #5 — Widescreen: HUD / UI elements are stretched — FIXED

On the projection-and-stretch widescreen path, 3D geometry is squashed at GTE
projection time so the final frame stretch restores its proportions. Screen-space
2D elements (HUD, menu text, cursors) are **not** projected through the squashed
RTPS path, so the final stretch widens them: the HUD and UI render proportionally
stretched in 16:9 / 21:9. Reported during play validation of the v0.0.3-era
widescreen build.

**Investigated 2026-07-10 (GP0 ring + wtrace provenance, Fossil Field).**
- Ape's in-game HUD is mostly **polygons** (gouraud-textured quads/tris 0x3C/
  0x34/0x3E), not SPRT rects: cookie stack, gadget cross. Only the L2 chip and
  sparkle dots are SPRTs (0x65/0x67). The framework's untagged-SPRT
  `hud_sprt_squash` therefore cannot cover it, and untagged polys can't be
  blanket-squashed (the world is polys).
- Geometric proof of no-squash: gadget cross spans x 267..366 (flush right, a
  squash around centre would end it at ~341); cookie stack starts at x=7 (squash
  would put it at ~31). Both sit at authored 4:3 positions in the squashed frame.
- HUD packets are heap-allocated inline with world packets (single per-frame
  arena; addresses shift frame to frame; absolute submission order is
  interleaved), so neither packet address nor a flat command index is a stable
  classifier. The pause menu is the exception (dedicated static arena
  ~0xCA000-0xCBxxx, world not redrawn while paused).
- Producer map (wtrace writers → generated-C call graph):
  `func_8005BF70` (2588 B, jump-table-invoked, no static JAL callers) is the
  UI/HUD orchestrator. It calls the gadget-cross drawer `0x80043A8C` (dedicated,
  builder `0x80044EF4`), the L2-chip drawer `0x800691F8` (dedicated, SPRT-store
  leaf `0x8002B380`), and the HUD cookie-stack path `0x80063628 → 0x80017CD4 →
  0x800180B8`. Below `0x800180B8` the model-draw helpers (`0x8001B3CC`, the
  `0x8001A3xx` store loops) are **shared with world object rendering** — the
  HUD/world discrimination point is the orchestrator subtree, not the builders.

**Failed validation 2026-07-19.** Function-bracketing and packet-writer guesses
did not cover the title screen, the four-button gadget UI, or all character
draw paths. A 21:9 gameplay capture also showed squashed Spike and unacceptable
scene gaps. Those per-game hooks are disabled. The replacement must distinguish
GTE-projected geometry from screen-space UI at the submitted packet itself and
must pass paired 4:3 / 16:9 / 21:9 image checks before this issue is closed.

**Fixed 2026-07-27.** The framework now implements the `auto_ui_squash`
configuration already selected by Ape. Before a GPU DMA linked list is
executed, a read-only pass finds the highest ordering-table rank that actually
contains eligible textured UI. It groups adjacent glyphs/icons by texture and
screen row, computes the complete run bounds, and assigns one left/centre/right
anchor to every primitive in that run. The streamed GP0 commands are then
proportion-corrected around that shared anchor. This removes the old per-glyph
thirds decision that pulled the first and last letters of centred text in
opposite directions.

The classifier uses current-frame submission provenance rather than guest
function names, packet addresses, or one-frame-old geometry. Depth-sorted world
packets (including Spike) are below the selected UI layer, large backdrops are
excluded, and trailing empty ordering-table buckets no longer hide the real
front layer.

Validated on OpenGL with:

- 16:9 instruction text (`Capture 3 monkeys`), gameplay HUD, pause wheel, exit
  confirmation, and captured-monkey counter;
- 21:9 gameplay HUD and captured-monkey icons;
- the load/memory-card screen, which Ape's existing full-2D detector safely
  returns to 4:3 so its file names, percentages, and centred rows remain
  coherent; and
- widescreen disabled, where the 4:3 path reports identity squash and zero UI
  transforms.

The grouping math has a standalone regression test covering centred glyph
runs, right-edge icon runs, separated left/right runs, and dense menu anchoring.

## Notes

- These are **enhancement-tier** items on the experimental widescreen path.
  4:3 is the authentic default and is byte-for-byte the original presentation.
- Widescreen is offered on both the OpenGL and Software renderers and was
  validated primarily on OpenGL (the shipping default).
